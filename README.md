This is a **React** clone of the **Airbnb Home Page**. The goal of this project was to recreate the layout and functionality of Airbnb's landing page using React and other modern web development tools. This clone allows users to browse featured listings, explore various destinations, and interact with an elegant, user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is fully responsive and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **React Components**: The page is built with reusable React components for easy maintainability and scalability.
- **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Uses mock data to dynamically render listings, featured properties, and other UI elements.
- **Search Functionality**: Implements a simple search bar to filter locations or listings.
- **Styled with CSS**: Clean and modern design inspired by the official Airbnb homepage.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For seamless navigation between pages.
- **CSS (Styled Components / SCSS)**: For styling the page with modern CSS techniques.
- **Axios**: For API calls (if needed for dynamic data fetching).
- **Material UI** (Optional): For quick component building and styling.
